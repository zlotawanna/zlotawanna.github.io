<h1>{{ "Hello World!" | downcase }}</h1>
<p>I am junior developer enthusiastic about Ruby programming language and Ruby on Rails framework.</p>
<p>This technology stack interests me for a long time (back in 2017 I have attended Rails Girls in Krakow), but last year was the most intensive as far as gathering knowledge about it. I have completed couple online courses and self-taught myself by developing my own projects.
I attempted to join Coders Camp. Unfortunately I did not get into it, however the intense preparation period gave solid skills in html and css. I also got familiar with js and react.</p>
<p>Starting with February 2022 I am taking part in mentoring program Tech Leaders. With my mentorâ€™s guidance I am developing my own application. This cooperation has significantly increased my skills. My biggest take from it is the ability to approach problems, identify them, see what are industry standards and apply solutions.</p>
