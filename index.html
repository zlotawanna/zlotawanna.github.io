  I am hobbyist programmer enthusiastic about Ruby programming language and Ruby on Rails framework.
  <br/><br/>This technology stack interests me for a long time (back in 2017 I have attended Rails Girls in Krakow), but last year was the most intensive as far as gathering knowledge about it. I have completed couple online courses (i.e Udemy - "The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course
", Codecademy - "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "React") and self-taught myself by developing my own projects.
  <br/><br/>I attempted to join Coders Camp. Unfortunately I did not get into it, however the intense preparation period gave solid skills in html and css. I also got familiar with js and react.
  <br/><br/>Starting with February 2022 I am taking part in mentoring program Tech Leaders. With my mentorâ€™s guidance I am developing my own application. This cooperation has significantly increased my skills.
  <br/><br/>My strong side is the ability to approach problems, identify them, see what are industry standards and apply solutions.
