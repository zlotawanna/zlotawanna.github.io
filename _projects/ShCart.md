ShCart is a project on which I was working with my mentor (who I met on the Tech Leaders Program).
It is an application for planning shopping lists based on weekly eating plan.
Working on that project helped me to get comfortable writing ruby code.
Learning areas:
- application architecture
- modules as namespaces
- safe navigation operator
- API requests with HTTParty
- RSpec tests
- colaboration with PostgreSQL
- new gems, i.e counter_culture

and more
