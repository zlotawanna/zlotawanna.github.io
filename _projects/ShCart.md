ShCart - shopping list generator. The project was being developed during the Tech Leaders Program in collaboration with my mentor.
For managing this project I was using Jira, Git workflow and some elements of Agile Scrum methodology.
Application is in progress, this is space for learning new things, sandbox. Working on that project helped me to get comfortable writing ruby code.
Learning areas:
- application architecture
- keeping code quality (safe navigation operator, modules as namespaces, following rubocop conventions)
- REST API
- RSpec tests
- background jobs with Sidekiq
- colaboration with PostgreSQL
- data export to different formats
- emails preparation
- front-end with Haml and Bootstrap 5
- new gems, i.e counter_culture, HTTParty, Prawn

and more
